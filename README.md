## Warning

This package is under development, use it at your own risks. API may change a lot from one version to another, function names may be misleading. Don't use unexported functions.

<!-- ## Warning : HauntedMatrix do not include ghosts

For now, only "HauntedVectors" include ghosts. Any higher dimensions arrays (such as `Matrix`) do not include ghost elements. -->
